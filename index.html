        <p>When nothing is going right, go left. They say learn from your mistakes. That's why I 'm making as many as possible. Soon, I'll be a genius! I am not lazy I am on energy saving mode. It takes real skills to choke on air, fall up the stairs and trip over nothing. I have those skills. Some people just need a high-five. In the face. With a chair. All my life I thought air was free. Then I bought a bag of chips.</p>

    <!-- Give this div a width of 600px, center it on the page, a solid yellow border that is 3px, and 10px of padding -->
    <div class='new-div'>
        <!-- Align the text in this p tag only to the right and give it 10px of padding -->
        <p>Maybe yarn is addicted to me! Ever though of THAT? It's better to have hooked and frogged than to never have hooked at all. I do not run from my problems. I sit on the couch, crochet, and ignore them like a normal adult. My crochet time is sometimes for your safety. Remember that. My problem is not that I buy too much yarn.... it's that I shop faster than I crochet! I crochet because life is more fun when you turn string into beautiful things.</p>
